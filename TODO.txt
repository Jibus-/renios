BUILD
* Produce builds for all appropriate ARM architectures, and for iPhone Simulator
* Write some docs up about the build system, and the patches
* Structure the patches to be less monolithic: one patch file for each logical change.

RUNTIME
* Get rid of screen blank during Ren'Py startup
* Change audio session type so iOS Music doesn't keep playing when the game launches
* Make CopyGameDirectory function check if the bundled resources have been updated, so it can update the Library copy.
* Make text inputs work with iOS keyboard
* Merge mouse up and down events (core.py:2257)?
* Some sort of UI for rollbacks
* Some sort of UI for skipping
* Bug when returning from resume: if in the middle of a transition(?) the transition is paused and does not resume, and so no further interaction is possible.
* Make sure storage for game assets is set up so that it doesnt get backed up, or deleted to free space by the OS (Library/Application Support with the no backup flag set)
* Deal with situationn where auto-save-on-suspend doesnt complete cleanly, and the game crashes when trying to reload it
* Test a game with movies
* Recover from audio session interruptions
* Get MultiPersistent working without call to mac_ver (missing expat error)

PACKAGING
* Make an Xcode project template.
* Write some docs on usage for a game creator.

OTHER
* Make a 'Ren'Py Player' app? (Allowing the user to import in zip files of any Ren'Py game, and play it.) (Actually, this probably won't fly due to the App Store restriction on executing downloaded code.)
