BUILD
* Produce builds for all appropriate ARM architectures, and for iPhone Simulator

RUNTIME
* Get rid of screen blank during Ren'Py startup
* Change audio session type so iOS Music doesn't keep playing when the game launches
* Make CopyGameDirectory function check if the bundled resources have been updated, so it can update the Library copy.
* Make text inputs work with iOS keyboard
* Merge mouse up and down events (core.py:2257)?
* Some sort of UI for rollbacks

PACKAGING
* Make an Xcode project template.

OTHER
* Make a 'Ren'Py Player' app? (Allowing the user to import in zip files of any Ren'Py game, and play it.) (Actually, this probably won't fly due to the App Store restriction on executing downloaded code.)
