BUILD

RUNTIME
* Crash on suspend
* Handle suspend and terminate cleanly (save state)
* Get rid of screen blank during Ren'Py startup
* Change audio session type so iOS Music doesn't keep playing when the game launches
* Make CopyGameDirectory function check if the bundled resources have been updated, so it can update the Library copy.

PACKAGING
* Make an Xcode project template.

OTHER
* Make a 'Ren'Py Player' app? (Allowing the user to import in zip files of any Ren'Py game, and play it.)
