Ren'iOS
=======

Ren'iOS helps you package a [Ren'Py](http://www.renpy.org) game into an app that will run on iOS. It builds versions of Ren'Py and its dependencies that will run on iOS, and provides scripts to help you assemble these with your game into an Xcode project that will build for iOS.

You can download a pre-built binary distribution from here:

https://github.com/chrismear/renios/releases

**NOTE:** This is still very early, proof-of-concept code. There are known bugs and missing UI. It is not ready to use for a public release of a game.

License
-------

Some portions of Ren'iOS are based on works licensed under the LGPL (various versions). Therefore these portions are also licensed under the LGPL.

Because of these portions which must be licensed under an LGPL, the single license that applies to Ren'iOS taken as a whole is the LGPL Version 2.1.

In addition to that license, those portions of Ren'iOS that are not required to be licensed under the LGPL are also individually licensed under the [MIT (Expat) license](http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Expat).

Each file/directory in Ren'iOS contains a permissions notice that indicates which license(s) apply to that file/directory.

An application binary that you build using Ren'iOS should not itself need to be licensed under the LGPL.
