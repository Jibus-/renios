Ren'iOS incorporates work from pygame covered by the following copyright and permission notice:

    This library is distributed under GNU LGPL version 2.1, which can
    be found in the file "doc/LGPL". I reserve the right to place
    future versions of this library under a different license.
    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html

    This basically means you can use pygame in any project you want,
    but if you make any changes or additions to pygame itself, those
    must be released with a compatible license. (preferably submitted
    back to the pygame project). Closed source and commercial games are
    fine.

    The programs in the "examples" subdirectory are in the public
    domain.

Ren'iOS incorporates work from Python covered by the following copyright and permission notice:

    provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and PSF's notice of copyright,
    i.e., "Copyright (c) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010,

    INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

    5. PSF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON
    FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS
    A RESULT OF MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON,

    breach of its terms and conditions.

    trademarks or trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote
    products or services of Licensee, or any third party.

    8. By copying, installing or otherwise using Python, Licensee
    agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License

        obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files
        (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction,

    Portions of Ren'Py are derived from code that is copyright using the
    Lesser GNU Public License, so Ren'Py games must be distributed in a
    manner that satisfies the LGPL.

    Please see each individual source file for a list of copyright
    holders. The artwork in the demo is released by various copyright
    holders, under the same terms.

    Ren'Py binaries include code from the following projects:

    * Python (Python License)
    * Pygame (LGPL)
    * SDL (LGPL)
    * SDL_image (LGPL)
    * SDL_ttf (LGPL)
    * Freetype (LGPL)
    * Fribidi (LGPL)
    * libav (LGPL)
    * libjpeg-turbo (LGPL)
    * libpng (PNG license)
    * zlib (Zlib License)
    * bzip2 (Bzip2 License)
    * pyobjc (MIT License)
    * py2exe (MIT License)
    * GLEW (Modified BSD, MIT)
    * zsync (Artistic License)

    For the purpose of LGPL compliance, the source code to all LGPL
    software we depend on is either in the Ren'Py package (available from
    http://www.renpy.org/), or in the renpy-deps package
    (http://www.renpy.org/dl/lgpl/). We believe compliance can be achieved
    by including a copy of this license with every copy of Ren'Py you
    distribute, and referring to it in your project's README file.

    Ren'Py may be distributed alongside the jEdit or Editra text
    editors. Editra is licensed under the wxWindows license, while
    jEdit is under the GNU General Public License.
