Ren'iOS |version| Documentation
===============================

Ren'iOS helps you package a `Ren'Py <http://www.renpy.org>`_ game into an app that will run on iOS. It builds versions of Ren'Py and its dependencies that will run on iOS, and provides scripts to help you assemble these with your game into an Xcode project that will build for iOS.

You can download a pre-built binary distribution from here:

https://github.com/chrismear/renios/releases

Source code and issue tracking is here:

**NOTE:** This is still very early, proof-of-concept code. There are known bugs and missing UI. It is not ready to use for a public release of a game.
